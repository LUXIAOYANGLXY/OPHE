Python code implementation of OPHE's comparative experiment PBCS(PBCS stands for E2SE)

Description

E2SE is a system for securely storing private data in the cloud with the help of a key server (an App server). With this system, a user could use one password to have access to the private data at any device. The plain data is visible to the legitimate user with correct password on client side and blind to both the cloud and key server.
